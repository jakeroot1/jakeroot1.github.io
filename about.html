			<h2>A bit of background:</h2>
			<p>I began my urban geography studies at Gov John Rogers High School in Puyallup, Washington. There, I took several geography courses and began to learn about coding and web design. I left school for several years while I assessed my personal life, before returning to school in 2018. I became aware of the University of Washington's new <i>Urban Design</i> degree, and things took off from there. I am now working as a part-time "GIS-er". I enjoy playing city simulation games in my free time.
